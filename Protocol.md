# Safe Place v0.1 

Safe Place is a proposal of the open protocol for the for video surveilance IoT implementations using crowdfunding approach

Issue of the current video surveillance systems:

###Issue #1. One video surveylance system from government is not enough   

- Government video surveylance systems located on the streets can not cover enough areas and achieve enough level of details to get required quality of pictures
- Scaling of the government systems cost significantly for the budget.
- Placement of the video cameras is well known and static.
- System is always closed and usually unavailable to the people.

###Issue #2. Commercial and private systems are disorganized.

-The systems don’t share any standard of communication the share of video with results (with geo and time tags included)
- In order to find some picture you need some complex process to get the source
and owner of the video.
	
###Issue 3. Mobile video cameras in the cars works only during motion.
-It is not possible to capture video effectively around the car during park mode
which usually lost much longer than moving.
-All the video-capture devices don’t share information effectively.
	
###Issue 4. Video capture system in the Smart Home have commons vulnerabilities
- one channel of communication and one storage. 
- rubber can damage the channel and take away the storage with video records.
