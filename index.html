<p>Issue of the current video surveillance systems:</p>

<h3>
<a id="issue-1-one-video-surveylance-system-from-government-is-not-enough" class="anchor" href="#issue-1-one-video-surveylance-system-from-government-is-not-enough" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issue #1. One video surveylance system from government is not enough</h3>

<ul>
<li>Government video surveylance systems located on the streets can not cover enough areas and achieve enough level of details to get required quality of pictures</li>
<li>Scaling of the government systems cost significantly for the budget.</li>
<li>Placement of the video cameras is well known and static.</li>
<li>System is always closed and usually unavailable to the people.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="issue-2-commercial-and-private-systems-are-disorganized" class="anchor" href="#issue-2-commercial-and-private-systems-are-disorganized" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issue #2. Commercial and private systems are disorganized.</h3>

<p>-The systems don’t share any standard of communication the share of video with results (with geo and time tags included)</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to find some picture you need some complex process to get the source
and owner of the video.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="issue-3-mobile-video-cameras-in-the-cars-works-only-during-motion" class="anchor" href="#issue-3-mobile-video-cameras-in-the-cars-works-only-during-motion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Issue #3. Mobile video cameras in the cars works only during motion.</h3>

<p>-It is not possible to capture video effectively around the car during park mode
which usually lost much longer than moving.
-All the video-capture devices don’t share information effectively.</p>

Video capture system in the Smart Home have commons vulnerabilities</h3>

<ul>
<li>one channel of communication and one storage. </li>
<li>rubber can damage the channel and take away the storage with video records.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to define common standard for IoT of crowd video surveillance systems to be implemented globally.
The standard must have technical and legal support aligned with constraints for each country.</p>

<p>Global</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Video surveillance system is implemented in the country according to the local standards</p></li>
<li><p>All the global storage is managed by several providers (as commercial and governments) and located inside country</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Car's part</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Each person can install some smart device into his own car to connect the network using special
commercial of government provider.
Video records can be collected around the car in the 7 days by 24 hours mode.
These records can be collected in the local storage 
Some extraction to the cloud is possible according to the rules (see below)<br>
Some processing is possible according to the rules (see below)  </p>

<p>Home part </p>

<ul>
<li>Each person and company can install smart device into its home or office the ensure protection.
Video records can be collected in the local storage 
Some extraction to the cloud is possible according to the rules (see below)<br>
Some processing is possible according to the rules (see below)<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Drone part</p>

<ul>
<li>providers and home owners can use drones to implement very fast speeds to ensure video surveillance
in the exact places with specific parameters </li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud part</p>

<ul>
<li>Government systems can extract information from all the personal sources with notifications</li>
<li>P2P information exchange between persons and companies is available by request/response.
Like: please send to me video from you camera: point x1, y1, date:12.01.2016 start: 12:00, end 12:05 
I need to get info about cars my clash. Here is clarification (attachments). =&gt; some payments for help </li>
<li>Government to persons: is an open question</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Search for information (geo, time, source type)</li>
<li>Keep info request (for later possible extraction)</li>
<li>Geo alert (signs of the fight on the street, bank robbery)
=&gt; Activate all the possible cams for the following operations</li>
<li>Follow up mode
=&gt; All the devices fix up the required object and their history and parameters
    (men’s in black took car number #123 and went to some street).</li>
</ul>

<h1></h1>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Technical, economy and functional  aspects</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Costs of the video camera, processing and networking is distributed between
car owners, home owners and companies</p></li>
<li><p>Effective usage of networks, storage, electricity</p></li>
<li>
<p>Global coverage due to the shared protocols and crowd funding approach for video surveillance</p>

<p>Usually all the detectives has to interview eyewitnesses.
Safe Place devices can provide complete 3d picture with timing and geo location.
Here cars with possible Safe Place installation are marked with red lines.

<a id="possible-benefits-for-the-society" class="anchor" href="#possible-benefits-for-the-society" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Possible benefits for the Society</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Safe area and significant decrease of criminal levels in secured areas</p></li>
<li><p>Video cameras can be everywhere. They are dynamic (with cars), fast to process and easy to communicate</p></li>
<li>
<p>Cars become unbreakable. It is often possible to damage one car security system.
It is almost impossible to break the systems of several cars standing along.
Cars like the Fellowship of the Ring can support each other.
If one car is stolen then other will save the history and will try to process the face recognition
In online mode to capture results, follow-up the stolen car during its way.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Actually the KPI it to almost eliminate robbery, murders, cars stolen and connected types of criminal at all </p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps this solution can be very important in Germany, France and other countries in Europe to help with
current issues. It can be also usefull in USA to align activities of police and people and solve some issues around famous incidents. </p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>It is possible to find lost people and children by organizing search by faces in time and geo location</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Split of the communication standards in the Smart home actually stopped a lot of innovations.</p></li>
<li><p>The area of video surveillance is in its early stage. It has change to update existing solutions 
and build new system with common standard</p></li>
<li><p>Absence of such a standard and communication can decrease the benefits from separated systems</p></li>
